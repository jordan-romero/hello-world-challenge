CORs issues: 
Console Error: Access to fetch at 'https://storage.googleapis.com/hw-challenge-assets/course-level-view/course.json' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.

Attempted to solve with mode: 'no-cors' in Fetch headers and by using proxys -- neither worked. Utilizing a chrome extension that bypasses cors to continue development.
