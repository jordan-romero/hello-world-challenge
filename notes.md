CORs issues: 
Console Error: Access to fetch at 'https://storage.googleapis.com/hw-challenge-assets/course-level-view/course.json' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.

Attempted to solve with mode: 'no-cors' in Fetch headers and by using proxys -- neither worked. Utilizing a chrome extension that bypasses cors to continue development. 

Paused at 2hrs to start styling - will finish functionality tomorrow. 2/13 3:40 

Course - forgot that setting state is async for a sec - threw in a ternary to fix render errors on refresh (Error: blank.map is not a function) <-- I swear this happens to me every time I start a react project so I just wanted to remind myself in the future LOL

Decided to use SASS for styling as I am most comfortable with it and wanted to respect the time limitations.
